# Repository for used code in Sosci Survey

Collection of code for use with [Sosci survey](https://www.soscisurvey.de).

In the folder `scales` you will find exported scales (mostly in German) in the XML format that were used by colleauges and me with the questionnaire software SoSci survey.

In the folder `php-code` you will find phf code in txt format to be adjusted and copied into your SoSci project.

I wholeheartedly thank the team of SoSci for their maintenance of the SoSci survey software and the help I have received over the years.
